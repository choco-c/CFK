            <h1>The origin of Choco's Fried Kitten:</h1>
            It all started sometime in the middle of 2024, when an idea popped into what might be the 21st century's smartest human alive; <br>
            Choco, who's a vegan, came up with -- while probably chatting in the now deleted "MushyPolter's Community" Discord Server (🫡) -- a work of genius...<br>
            "CFK", a truly beautiful tear-to-eye bringing play on words, Choco's Fried Kitten was born, and so was greatness.<br>
            It, as you already know, stands for "Choco's Fried Kitten" which when acronymised, is a semordnilap of KFC, a show of their awe-inspiring way with words, and letters.<br>
            <br>
            But this was not even the beginning, 'twas but many months later this idea came to fruition, as a website. <br>
            Choco laid their eyes upon a video on the popular video-hosting platform, known as YouTube, around the 9th day of November, 2025. <br>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/5Akr1SYk-eU?si=a7zU2SQCOpEiDxOc">"How to Make a Restaurant Website Using HTML CSS & JavaScript"</a> was the name of said video.<br>
            Filled with excitement they clicked on the video, spending hours writing every single line of code almost exactly as instructed, they were unstoppable.<br>
            This was because they had an idea so great nothing could get in it's way, it was of course manifesting the message of CFK through the means of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            <br>
            Days went by as the website expanded, more menu items were added, suggestions were approved, eventually the site went public via GitHub, thanks to who the website could be on the internet at no cost!<br>
            Collaberations with none other than Silly Red and Frog occured, both contributing to the site by creating their own special sauce and their breathtaking auditory artworks that will send one's ears bleeding from admiration.
